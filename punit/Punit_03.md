# PU Lesson 3 Creating Functions

## Practice 1 Creating a function 

Create a function to decide if the job tenure of an employee is greater than 13 years.

The function specification is as the following: 
`is_senior(p_employee_id number) return integer`

Parameter:
`p_employee_id`: employee id 

Return values:
- 1 represents true 
- 0 represents false 

You can use the following statement to calculate the job tenure in years for an employee:

```sql
v_tenure := months_between(SYSDATE, v_hire_date)/12;
```

Use the following SQL statement to test your function:

```sql
SELECT employee_id, first_name, hire_date, trunc((CURRENT_DATE - hire_date)/365) AS seniority, is_senior(employee_id) "Senior Employee" FROM employees ;
```

Sample outputsï¼š
```
100	Steven	17-JUN-03	15	1
101	Neena	21-SEP-05	13	1
102	Lex	13-JAN-01	18	1
103	Alexander	03-JAN-06	13	1
104	Bruce	21-MAY-07	12	0
105	David	25-JUN-05	13	1
106	Valli	05-FEB-06	13	1
107	Diana	07-FEB-07	12	0
108	Nancy	17-AUG-02	16	1
```

## Practice 2 Handling exceptions in functions

Create a function `DEPT_NAME`. 
The function should return the department name when an employee id is given. 

The function should catch any exceptions and handle them. Return a null value whenever exceptions occur. 

To test your function, please use the following codes: 

```sql
set SERVEROUTPUT ON
begin
  for i in 100..200 loop
    dbms_output.put_line( i || ' ' || dept_name(i));
  end loop;
end;
/
```

Note that the department name for employee id 178 is null in the sample outputs:
```
...
176 Sales
177 Sales
178 
179 Sales
180 Shipping
181 Shipping
...
```

## Practice 3 Using stored function in SQL statements

Create the function `emp_country_name`. By giving an employee id, the function should return the country name in which the employee's department locates. When exceptions occur, the function should catch them and return the following message `!! Invalid employee id !!` .

Use the following SQL statement to test your function:
```sql
select e.EMPLOYEE_ID, last_name, emp_country_name(employee_id)
from employees e	
where e.EMPLOYEE_ID in (100, 145, 201, 178)
order by 1;
```

Sample outputs:
```
100	King	United States of America
145	Russell	United Kingdom
178	Grant	!!Invalid employee id!!
201	Hartstein	Canada
```
