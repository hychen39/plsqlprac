# Fund Lesson 3 Practices

## Practice 1

The employee with ID 104 gets the salary raise for the first time when he has worked for one year since his hire date. The salary will be increased by 10%.

Please print out the date to increase the salary the first time and the new salary.

## Practice 2

Create a new script sheet for the practice. Copy and modify the codes in the practice 1 to complete the practice.

Use the bind variable as the input to query the salary of employee with ID 104. The increased salary should be saved to a bind variable. 

After executing the block, you should print out the values of the two bind variables. 
 

When executing the block, you should press the F5 key to execute the whole script. Do not execute line-by-line by pressing Ctrl + Enter.

## Practice 3

Find the department name where the employee with ID 200 works. Save the department name to the variable `v_dept_name` and print it out.

The variable type should reference the `department_name` column in the `departments` table.
